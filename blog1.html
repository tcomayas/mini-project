					<p>Plants can be included in our homes in many ways and there is a plant suited for every home and
						every corner. There is no room or corners that a plant cannot uplift and all they need in return
						is a little bit of light, water, and love.
						Let’s start at the doorways, one of the most neglected spaces in the urban setup. Most of us
						either rent or buy flats and have no say in lobby design or how the main door looks, but you can
						always make your entryway standout by adding plants by the door. Add plants that grow erect and
						show variegations to save space as well as create interest in your home. If your doorway
						receives sun or bright indirect light go with stunning tropical plants like ferns or calatheas
						and for darker spaces go for dracaenas, ZZs or bromeliads. Another great idea to add some visual
						appeal and fun to your entryway is to add hanging planters alongside the doorway with other
						hanging knick-knacks.
						<br>
						<br>

						Beyond the doorway, plants can do so much for a home. They can break monotony, add life to
						corners, create nooks that are a personal oasis, glam up your décor and improve the overall air
						and sound quality of a home. Add tall arching plants next to your seating spaces for a canopy
						like effect and let the climbers loose on your window grills for both privacy and cleaner air.
						Plants can also function as room dividers and break up large spaces or create intimate corners
						with plant clusters around a reading chair – books, plants, coffee, what more can one need?
