					<p>Our Story <br><br>

						DAHON was founded in May 2020, amid a global pandemic, by people who shared the same passion for
						nature. We believed that many too should appreciate nature, which is often overlooked because of
						the hustle and bustle of life. But because 2020 was the year that everyone had the time and the
						opportunity to enjoy and appreciate the little things, we thought that it was the right time to
						reach out to everyone and share the same passion. Our goal was to bring a piece of nature into
						every home that meant more than just aesthetics. In just three months, we were able to reach
						hundreds of people. The reach was so impressive that we were able to hit our sales target much
						earlier than anticipated — in just three months! <br><br>

						People chose DAHON not only for its plants, but also for its offerings of hassle-free online
						shopping, safe delivery options, and premium customer service. As of the moment, Dahon has sold
						more than 50,000 pots and has grown its team into a group of ten hard-working people. <br><br>

						DAHON has also expanded its operations to include its own headquarters and nursery in Cebu as
						well as a physical store in SM City Cebu and SM Seaside. With hundreds of orders every week and
						a growing audience of plant lovers, the collective interest in bringing nature into the home is
						showing no signs of stopping.</p>
